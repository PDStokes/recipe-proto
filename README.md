## Recipe Scraping Prototype

> Nuxt app that scrapes an inputted recipe website for pertinent information

The goal of this prototype is to create an app which scrapes recipe data from a website, negating the obnoxious amount of extraneous information and ads that users must usually scroll through, and displays this recipe information in a succinct manner.

A additional goal is to utilize local storage to allow the user to store these scraped recipes for a specified amount of time on whatever device they use to access the app.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
