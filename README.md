## Recipe Scraping Prototype

> Nuxt app that scrapes an inputted recipe website for pertinent information

The goal of this prototype is to create an app which scrapes recipe data from a website, negating the obnoxious amount of extraneous information and ads that users must usually scroll through, and displays this recipe information in a succinct manner.

A additional goal is to utilize local storage to allow the user to store these scraped recipes for a specified amount of time on whatever device they use to access the app.

Future stretch goals would be to include Machine Learning, so as to flexibly account for more use cases.

*Disclaimer: This project is purely an experiment and not intended for wide-scale or commercial use.  If utilized for learning or personal use, it should be used **ONLY** on website/s or services where its functionality is not prohibited by Terms of Service (ToS), and used with reasonably low frequency so as not to abuse another website/s or services bandwidth.*
